# Personal Project: *Cheforie*

## An app that picks your meals for you.

This purpose of this application is to generate a random meal plan based on the recipes provided by the user. The
meal plan will include breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The application will make sure that the generated meal plan stays
within the calorie limit set by the user.

This application is for people that have trouble deciding what to eat every day as it randomly generates a new meal
plan for each day. It is also for people who have restricted their calories to a certain amount due to fitness goals.
In this scenario people usually tend to eat the same meal every day since they know the exact macros and calories in
their
meal; however, they eventually get tired of eating the same thing over and over again. My application will help them in
this
endeavour as they can add multiple recipes that are suitable for their fitness
goals and the application will help them by generating a new combination of meals every day that stays within the
desired
calorie limit.

This project is of interest to me as I have faced similar problems when trying to stay within a given caloric limit
for my fitness goals. I found it very hard to decide what to eat every day, due to which I started having the same meal
each day over a long period of time. After the first week or so, I would get tired of eating the same meal, but
it would always feel like a lot of work to add new meals and decide what to eat every day while also making sure about 
tracking my calories. I believe this application will be beneficial to me and people with similar struggles as it 
automates the entire process of choosing what to eat while making sure to target the provided caloric limit.
